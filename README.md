Notes: The lab assignment only called for the cubes' rotations, though I added some orbiting behavior to the magenta cube to spice things up a bit.

### Part 2

Notes: I decided to experiment a little bit here. I chose a simple model to start (the cone) and two more complicated models, one of which was very low poly, and the other was high poly. The arrangement is simple: the dragon and monster are merely admiring the cone. I added some fill lights to flesh out the models, though. Particularly I chose a cyan to make the monster more aquatic seeming, a brighter white fill off to the back left, and a leftward greyish yellow green for the last bits.
