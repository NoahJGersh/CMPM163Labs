Notes: The lab assignment only called for the cubes' rotations, though I added some orbiting behavior to the magenta cube to spice things up a bit.

### Part 2

Notes: I decided to experiment a little bit here. I chose a simple model to start (the cone) and two more complicated models, one of which was very low poly, and the other was high poly. The arrangement is simple: the dragon and monster are merely admiring the cone. I added some fill lights to flesh out the models, though. Particularly I chose a cyan to make the monster more aquatic seeming, a brighter white fill off to the back left, and a leftward greyish yellow green for the last bits.

### Cube Materials

**Center Cube:** The original Phong shaded cube from the assignment.

**Left Cube:** Lambert shaded cube with linear opacity modulation.

**Right Cube:** Additional Phong shaded cube with different diffuse, spec, and shininess values.

**Top Cube:** Original cube with depth-based linear interpolation.

**Bottom Cube:** Cube with modified shader code from the top cube. Specified color values are modified by a sine wave function, resulting in depth-based striations.
